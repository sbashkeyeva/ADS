1. Minimum number of edges is: (n-k). Cause if we have at least two components where only three vertices exist; there is only one edge that could construct two components.
2. There are 16 simple paths from vertex 1 to 2 with five vertices. 
  A simple representation of it could be seen below: 
  1 2 
  1 # 2
  1 # # 2
  1 # # # 2 
3. Connected graph is always connected no matter which edge to delete, so the answer equals to 0.
